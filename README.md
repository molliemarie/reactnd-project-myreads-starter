# MyReads Project

## About the App

The MyReads project allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. 

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.

The main page also has a link to a search page that allows you to find books to add to a shelf in your library.
